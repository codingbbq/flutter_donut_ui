## Live stream logs

The idea of this live stream is to document my learnings in Flutter. 


# What went well
- Used Provider widget to maintain the state at various levels.
- Implemented http widget to get data from API. With this also learned how to create Dart Objects out of the response json.
- Implemented custom Painter on the UI. 
- Did data management and so had to spend couple of hours getting images and maintaining data.

# What did not go well
- The entire app looked decent however some areas were not implemented. 
- Did not implement the third screen in the design.

Below are screenshot of the final UI
